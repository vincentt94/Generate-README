  ## Description
  Every developer needs a  useful and meaningful README whenever they are deploying a new project.  Creating a README can be a tedious and time consuming task.  In order to save time for a developer, I was able to generate a boiler-plate README through a series of questions utilizing node.js.  This project helped me further my understanding of node.js as well as deepen my grasp of functions, parameters within functions, and syntax significance.

  ## Installation
  In order to install this application a  user would first have to create two javascript files.  For the purposes of this example, we will create an index.js and a helper.js.  After creating both javascript files, the user will have to initialize a Node Packaging Manager.   To do so, the user can open their terminal and type in the command 'npm init -y' .  This will result in a package.json being created.  Navigate to the that package.json and after the quotation marks behind "type":  insert a ' , ' then hit enter and paste ' "type": "module" ' .  Doing this enables ES 6 modules.  Once we finish this, we will go back to the terminal and install the inquirer package.  Navigate to the terminal again and type 'npm i inquirer' . Now the user can paste the index.js code into the javascript file named 'index.js' and the helper.js code into the 'helper.js' file.  This step is very important.
